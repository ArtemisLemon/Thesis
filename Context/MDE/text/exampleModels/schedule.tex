$$\inlineocl{Session.requisite.forall(r|r.week.number < Session.week.number)}$$
$$\inlineocl{Session.corequisite.forall(r|r.week.number = Session.week.number)}$$

In \ytodo{this figure} we see an example metamodel for a schedule.
We have as concepts sessions and weeks.
Weeks are identified by a week number.
Sessions are assigned to weeks, and have prerequisite sessions that must be done during a prior week, and correcquisite sessions which must be done the same week.
