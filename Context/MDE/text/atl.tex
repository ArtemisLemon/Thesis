\subsection{Atlas Transformation Language}
The Atlas Transformation Language provides a means to specify model-to-model transformations in EMF.
% ATL can be  to chain model to model transformations allowing for automated modeling pipelines.
ATL extends OCL to define rules in the context of multiple Classes.
These rules associate properties across the classes using OCL queries, in what is called: a binding.
Just like OCL, ATL can be written declaratively, but ATL also allows for imperative sections, which are sometimes necessary to specify \textit{steps} required to transform an object into another.

$$\inlineocl{rule A from s:Session to r:Rectangle (r.text <- s.name)}$$
$$\inlineocl{rule B from w:Week to r:Rectangle (r.contains <- A(w.sessions))}$$
Here we see two simplified rules which describe a transformation from the Scheduling example to the GUI example.
Rule A describes how to make a GUI element from a session in the schedule.
Rule A shows a simple binding \inlineocl{r.text <- s.name} between the text of a rectangle and the name of a session.
Rule B describes how to make a GUI element from a week in the schedule.
\inlineocl{w.sessions} is the collection of sessions assigned to a week.
\inlineocl{A(w.sessions)} is the result of rule A applied to the prior collection, which is a collection of rectangles.
Finally we bind \inlineocl{r.contains} of the resulting rectangle to the resulting collection.
