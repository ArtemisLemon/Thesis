% \chapter{Context: Model Driven Engineering \& Constraint Programming}

% \begin{outline}
%     \item MDE provides modeling languages and tools to manipulate models
%     \item CP uses the CSP as a modeling language, and provides algorithms to find solutions
%     \item There have been effort to connect MDE modeling languages and CSP
%     \item There is still improvements to be found in the context of the word "Integer" 
% \end{outline}

% The work presented in this thesis exists at the intersection of Model Driven Engineering and Constraint Programming.
% Model Driven Engineering provides a modeling framework aligned with modern software engineering.
% Constraint Programming provides provides with exact and explainable Artificial Intelligence.

% Translating from MDE models to
