\textbf{Constraint Programming} \cite{HoeveK06} is a powerful paradigm that offers a generic and modular approach to modeling and solving combinatorial problems.

% A CP model consists of a set of variables $X=\{x_1,\ldots, x_n\}$, a set of domains $\mathcal{D}$ mapping each variable $x_i\in X$ to a finite set of possible values $dom(x_i)$, and a set of constraints $\mathcal{C}$ on $X$, where each constraint $c$ defines a set of values that a subset of variables $X(c)$ can take. 
% %%
% Domains can be either bounded, defined as an interval $\{lb..ub\}$, or enumerated, explicitly listing all possible values (e.g., ${1, 10, 100, 1000}$). This distinction impacts the choice of constraints: for instance, the global cardinality constraint is more effective with enumerated domains. 
% %%
% An assignment on a set $Y \subseteq X$ of variables is a mapping from variables in $Y$ to values in their domains. A solution is an assignment on $X$ satisfying all constraints.
