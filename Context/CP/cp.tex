% \subsection{Constraint Programming}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item a CP model = CSP (avoid confusion with MDE Model)
%     \item CSP + Propagation + Search
%     \item CSP = V,D,C
%     \item global constraints: modeling and propagation
%     \item problem variables, intermediate variables and search
%     \item reification: constraints as variables
%     \item notable global constraint for this paper: element, gcc, stable keysort, regular

\textbf{Constraint Programming} \cite{HoeveK06} is a powerful paradigm that offers a generic and modular approach to modeling and solving combinatorial problems.

\subsection{Constraint Satisfaction Problems}
A CP model consists of a set of variables $X=\{x_1,\ldots, x_n\}$, a set of domains $\mathcal{D}$ mapping each variable $x_i\in X$ to a finite set of possible values $dom(x_i)$, and a set of constraints $\mathcal{C}$ on $X$, where each constraint $c$ defines a set of values that a subset of variables $X(c)$ can take. 
%%
Domains can be either bounded, defined as an interval $\{lb..ub\}$, or enumerated, explicitly listing all possible values (e.g., ${1, 10, 100, 1000}$). This distinction impacts the choice of constraints: for instance, the global cardinality constraint is more effective with enumerated domains. 
%%
An assignment on a set $Y \subseteq X$ of variables is a mapping from variables in $Y$ to values in their domains. A solution is an assignment on $X$ satisfying all constraints.

\subsection{CP Solvers}
\textbf{CP solvers} use backtracking search to explore the search space of partial assignments. The main concept used to speed up the search is constraint propagation by {\it filtering algorithms}. 
At each assignment, constraint filtering algorithms prune
the search space by enforcing local consistency properties like {\it domain consistency} (a.k.a., {\it Generalized Arc Consistency} (GAC)). A constraint $c$ on $X(c)$ is domain consistent, if and only if, for every  $x_i \in X(c)$ and every
$v \in dom(x_i)$, there is an assignment satisfying $c$ such that $(x_i = v)$.
