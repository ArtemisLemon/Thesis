ATL$^{\text{c}}$ provides an extension to the ATL allowing users to add OCL invariants to the targets of transformation specifications.
The two main model search applications of \atlc

\atlc provides a tool for Model Space Exploration.



\begin{outline}
    \item starting point of the thesis
    \item ATL is a model transformation tooling
    \item ATLc is a plugin, which allows you to gather constraint expressions from ATL code and pass it to different solvers
    \item provides a object oriented constraint metamodel in ecore
    \item instantiates constraint models for LP and CP solvers
