\ytodo{Prolog is a natural way to implement a language}

\ytodo{SWI-prlog and $ECL^iPS_e$ also provide constraint programming techniques ontop of prolog techniques}

\ytodo{EMF2CSP uses $ECL^iPS_e$ to neatly describe OCL, and leverage gobal constraints such as $element$ (like us)}

\ytodo{Important note (un-like us): This method will generate a different problem for each combination of collection sizes. Whereas we add the "what size is the collection" problem to the CSP.}
